# Deep Sea Trawling Plugin
The Deep Sea Trawling plugin is a RuneLite plugin that helps make the Deep Sea Trawling Sailing activity in Old School Runescape easier by helping to track all different kinds of fish shoals and their depths.

**Features:**
- **Shoal paths:** A line is drawn along the exact path that each shoal travels with arrows pointing the direction the shoal is moving. A box is drawn at each shoal stopping point.

- **Shoal tagging:** Tags each shoal with a colored square. Color changes depending on which kind of shoal it is.

- **Depth indicator:** A small indicator attached to each shoal shows what depth the shoal is currently at (Either "<font color="Green">Shallow</font>", "<font color="Orange">Medium</font>" or "<font color="red">Deep</font>"). Highlights your nets <font color="yellow">yellow</font> if the depth is at a different depth to the shoals current depth.
